# AB-Testing

Hello,

In this project,we inspect A/B Testing with random variables.

First of all, you do A/B testing for deciding whether which option is better i.e Aligning page to left or right.

I thought this can be changed into books.I assumed that their number of pages is the same so we do not have to scale them.
Basically,if you like more,you read more or if one's story is more attractive,then you wonder what is the next in further phases.
If you have 0.05 value then you can decide it is a little bit different from each other.
p test scores and t test scores are shown at the end of code.

We also generate number variables for rating.
If you like more,their rating will be higher than other one but this includes a little bit subjective results.
